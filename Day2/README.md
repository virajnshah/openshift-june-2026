## Info - Container Orchestration Platform Overview
<pre>
- In real world applications, no one uses plain docker/podman/containerd containers
- Container platforms provides the below features out of the box
  - in built application monitoring and healing them
  - in built load balancing 
  - on demand, depending user traffic to an application we can scale up/down the application instances
  - High Availability (HA)
  - they also provide a way to control access to your applicaiton
    - only to internal users/applications
    - expose your application for external use
- examples
  - Docker SWARM
  - Kubernetes
  - Rancher
  - Red Hat Openshift
  - AWS eks
  - Azure aks
  - AWS ROSA
  - Azure ARO
</pre>

## Info - Docker SWARM
<pre>
- this is native Container Orchestration Platform developed by Docker Inc
- it only supported Docker Containerized applications
- it is free but supports only docker no other container engine or runtime
- it is very easy to setup, learn
- it is not production grade
- ideal for learning, proof of concept, QA/Dev environment
- applications will be deployed as Docker container
- every container will get a IP
</pre>

## Info - Kubernetes (k8s)
<pre>
- this is a container orchestration plaform developed by Google in Golang
- this was originally called borg inside Google
- borg was used by Google many years in mulitple complex projects internally before they decided to make it opensource
- borg was refactored as Kubernetes improving many things
- Kubernetes is a better borg
- it is opensource and free
- it supports all container engines and runtimes
- initially, they supported Docker Engine as the default containerization tool
- applications will be deployed as Pod
- Pod - a group of related containers
- all containers in a single Pod will one get a single IP
- Pod is the smallest unit that can be deployed in Kubernetes
- it is a command-line tool, there is no production grade webconsole
- this is actually used in production by many companies
- Kubernetes provides a way to extend Kubernetes API and features by defining your own Custom Resources
  and Custom Resource Definitions
- To manage each type of Resource, there will one type of Controller
- The default resources supported by Kubernetes are
  - Pod
  - ReplicaSet
  - Deployment
  - StatefulSet
  - DaemonSet
  - Job
  - CronJob
  - Service
- there are two types of machines involved in the Kubernetes Cluster
  1. Master Node 
     - this machine runs components that provides the Container Orchestration Features for the cluster
     - by default, user application will not run here ( however, you can override/configure to allow deploying user applications )
     - this is where Control Plane Components will be running
       1. API Server
       2. etcd key/value database
       3. Scheduler
       4. Controller Manager(s)
          - this components hosts many Controllers
  2. Worker Node
     - this machine is where user application will be deployed
 - node are machines with dedicated linux OS, it can be Physical Server or Virtual Machine on your local datacenter, or an ec2 in public cloud
 - we can install any Linux OS distribution into the nodes
- Kubernetes allows to extend Kubernetes features ( K8s API)
  - you can add your custom resource, custom controller, Operators, etc
  - using thes building block one can add any new feature on top of Kubernetes
</pre>

## Info - Kubernetes High-Level Architecture
![Kubernetes](KubernetesArchitecture2.png)

## Info - Red Hat Openshift High-Level Architecture
![Openshift](openshiftArchitecture.png)
![Openshift](master-node.png)

## Info - Red Hat Openshift
<pre>
- is Red Hat's distribution of Kubernetes 
- it is developed on top of opensource Kubernetes, but this is commercial 
- it is a superset of Kubernetes with many additional features
- Using the K8s basic building block, Red Hat has added many additional useful features on top of K8s
- Openshift specific features ( not supported in K8s)
  - Route
  - DeploymentConfig
  - Project
  - Build
  - BuildConfig
  - Webconsole
  - User Management
  - Internal Container Image Registry ( comes out of the box )
</pre>

## Lab - Listing all the nodes in the Openshift cluster
```
oc get nodes
kubectl get nodes
```
<img width="1920" height="1200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de0b33c6-4f77-4ef4-b967-5d2bee04a694" />

## Info - Stateless applications
<pre>
- each call to a Pod will be treated as an independent invocation
- the Pod will have no clue which user called last time, it only know about the current session
- this kind of Pods can be replaced and repaired easily
- because for the end user it doesn't matter whether Pod1 is server them or Pod10 is serving them
- for this type of applications, you have something called Deployment in Kubernetes and OpenShift
- Deployment is a in-built Resource supported by Kubernetes and Openshift
</pre>

## Info - API Server
<pre>
- API is one of the Control Plane components that runs in master nodes
- API Server is a collection of many REST APIs for every feature supported by Openshift
- API Server is the only component that is allowed to read/write into etcd key/value datastore
- API Server sends events each time the etcd database is updated
  - New Pod created
  - Existing Pod modified
  - Existing Pod deleted
  - New Deployment created
  - Existing Deployment modified
  - Existing Deployment deleted
</pre>  

## Info - Deployment Controller
<pre>
- Controller is a special type of Pod that runs in the Kubernetes/Openshift cluster
- You can imagine this application as infinite loop
- controllers in general - are the ones who does the actual work
- Deployment Controller supports rolling update
  - used for upgrading your application from one version to the other ( without downtime )
- Deployment Controller depends on ReplicaSet Controller for Scale up/down
- For stateless application, 2 Controllers are involved
  1. Deployment Controller
     - Deployment Controller manages a Resource type called Deployment
     - Deployment is a collection of one or more ReplicaSet
     - ReplicaSet is a collection of one or more Pods
     - Pods is a logical group of one or more Containers
  2. ReplicaSet Controller
     - this ensure if user asked to run 3 Pods instances of their application, those 3 are always running
     - responsible scale up/down
     - ReplicaSet Controller manages a Resource type called ReplicaSet
</pre>

## Lab - Let's create our first project
Replace 'jegan' with your name because the project name must be unique within the Openshift Cluster.

Create a openshift project
```
oc new-project jegan
```

```
oc get projects
oc get project

## Lab - List the nginx images present in your Openshift Cluster
```
oc get imagestreams -n openshift

oc project openshift
oc get imagestreams

# Server 1
oc create deploy nginx --image==image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/nginx:1.26 --replicas=3

# Server 2
oc create deploy nginx --image==image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/bitnami-nginx:1.26 --replicas=3
```

List the deployment under your project
```
oc get deployments
oc get deployment
