## Lab - Check if you are able to access Openshift
```
oc version
kubectl version

oc get nodes
```

## Info - Container Orchestration Platform Overview
<pre>
- In real world applications, no one uses plain docker/podman/containerd containers
- Container platforms provides the below features out of the box
  - in built application monitoring and healing them
  - in built load balancing 
  - on demand, depending user traffic to an application we can scale up/down the application instances
  - High Availability (HA)
  - they also provide a way to control access to your applicaiton
    - only to internal users/applications
    - expose your application for external use
- examples
  - Docker SWARM
  - Kubernetes
  - Rancher
  - Red Hat Openshift
  - AWS eks
  - Azure aks
  - AWS ROSA
  - Azure ARO
</pre>

## Info - Docker SWARM
<pre>
- this is native Container Orchestration Platform developed by Docker Inc
- it only supported Docker Containerized applications
- it is free but supports only docker no other container engine or runtime
- it is very easy to setup, learn
- it is not production grade
- ideal for learning, proof of concept, QA/Dev environment
- applications will be deployed as Docker container
- every container will get a IP
</pre>

## Info - Kubernetes
<pre>
- this is a container orchestration plaform developed by Google in Golang
- this was originally called borg inside Google
- borg was used by Google many years in mulitple complex projects internally before they decided to make it opensource
- borg was refactored as Kubernetes improving many things
- Kubernetes is a better borg
- it is opensource and free
- it supports all container engines and runtimes
- initially, they supported Docker Engine as the default containerization tool
- applications will be deployed as Pod
- Pod - a group of related containers
- all containers in a single Pod will one get a single IP
- Pod is the smallest unit that can be deployed in Kubernetes
- it is a command-line tool, there is no production grade webconsole
- this is actually used in production by many companies
- Kubernetes provides a way to extend Kubernetes API and features by defining your own Custom Resources
  and Custom Resource Definitions
- To manage each type of Resource, there will one type of Controller
- The default resources supported by Kubernetes are
  - Pod
  - ReplicaSet
  - Deployment
  - StatefulSet
  - DaemonSet
  - Job
  - CronJob
  - Service
- there are two types of machines involved in the Kubernetes Cluster
  1. Master Node 
     - this machine runs components that provides the Container Orchestration Features for the cluster
     - by default, user application will run here ( however, you can override/configure to allow deploying user applications )
     - this is where Control Plane Components will be running
       1. API Server
       2. etcd key/value database
       3. Scheduler
       4. Controller Manager(s)
          - this components hosts many Controllers
  2. Worker Node
     - this machine is where user application will be deployed
 - node are machines with dedicated linux OS, it can be Physical Server or Virtual Machine on your local datacenter, or an ec2 in public cloud
 - we can install any Linux OS distribution into the nodes
